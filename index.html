            <h2>🧑🏾‍💻 About Me</h2>
            
            <p>
                I'm Andre Woods — a software developer, cybersecurity professional, and creative technologist originally from Los Angeles, California. I began teaching myself to code during late-night shifts as a security guard, and that spark evolved into a career built on discipline, curiosity, and purpose. I blend technical ability, military insight, and artistic passion to build digital tools, tell authentic stories, and serve my community.
